# Service Ticket Resolution: training question 005

- Upstream: https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/GDPevo

You are a mobile-data recovery analyst working a small case list.

Use the shared support console API at `<TASK_ENV_BASE_URL>`. The worklist is in `payloads/mobile_data_worklist.json`. For each case, select the primary operation, any follow-up operation, and the expected charge or carrier update if applicable.

Return only JSON that conforms to `payloads/answer_template.json`.

## Continuous training

This is `train_005`, one of this package's five training questions. **Run all five
Train Cases together in one Agent Session and one Harbor container. Launch the
training task once, not once per Case.** Keep the Session, workspace, business
environment and method state between questions; the Agent may revisit questions
and request feedback throughout learning. The whole training run has a six-hour
budget; this question has no separate timeout or turn limit.

Inside that container, read `/app/train_tasks/train_005/instruction.md` and its
`input/` files. Resolve `<TASK_ENV_BASE_URL>` and credentials from
`/app/environment_access.md`. The training judge accepts `task_id: "train_005"`.
At the end, export this answer to `/app/submission/answers/train_005.json` and the
learned Skill to `/app/submission/skill/SKILL.md`.

Follow the [training and State preparation instructions](https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/alpha-agent-harness-benchmark/blob/010fda6b775f864814188cde54efb8c927b4c6b9/data/alphaagentharness-benchmark-gdpevo-essential-service-ticket-resolution-train/README.md). From a checkout
of commit `010fda6b775f864814188cde54efb8c927b4c6b9`, launch once for this entire Train package:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/agents"
uvx --from harbor==0.23.0 harbor run -p data/alphaagentharness-benchmark-gdpevo-essential-service-ticket-resolution-train/tasks/train_tasks \
  -a alpha_agent:AlphaAgent -m <provider>/<model_id> \
  --ak thinking=<level> --ak alpha-version=<alpha-version> \
  --ak agent_state_tar=<absolute-training-state.tar.gz> \
  --ak run_timeout=6h --ak max_turns=-1 \
  --allow-agent-host <model-provider-api-host> \
  --agent-setup-timeout-multiplier 2.5 -k 1 -n 1 \
  --job-name <unique-training-job> -o <jobs-dir> -y
```

Save per-question scores from the shared trial's `verifier/training-summary.json`.
Count that trial's training cost, tokens and elapsed time once for the whole
package. Freeze the learned State before using the paired Test package.
